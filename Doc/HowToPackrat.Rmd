This document describes how to upgrade `packrat` for recent update in June 2014. Firstly, delate `.Rprofile`. Then install the up-to-date `packrat`. Also look at <https://github.com/rstudio/packrat/issues/111>.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/packrat", ref = "feature/source-repos")
```

Then, update previous packrat dependent files for upgraded version by running:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
packrat::migrate()
```

Then, check status by `packrat::status()`, and follow the returend instructions.
